        <font class="title-in">What is this?</font><br>
        <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.3;">
          An open source PHP/HTML Code that can run on a local server which can be used for file sharing over
          it's network. Once this code is hosted on a local server, users can access it inorder to upload files
          like photos, videos, music and other types of files into the server.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="matterHolder shadow randm bfE0">
          <font class="title-in">Why is this?</font><br>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.3;">
          The objective or motive behind this collection of pages is to allow file sharing between computer systems in a
          home or local network with the ease of using a simple interface.<br><br>
          To the normal custom of hosting a file for download by the server, this application creates a way for the connected
          devices both to access and upload files without using a third party software, but just a web-browser.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="matterHolder shadow randm">
          <font class="title-in">What is Developer Mode?</font><br>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.3;">
          This is an extension of the usual file sharing application to create and edit directories and upload and share files
          within then so as to bring a project structure, helping developer communities to enable working on a project over a
          local network.<br><br>
          The directory listings of project folders are allowed so as to facilitate the local access and run of respective contents.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="matterHolder shadow randm bfE0">
          <font class="title-in">Is it safe?</font><br>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.3;">
          Obviously this is safe if usued in the prescribed manner.<br>
          This version comes with some php pages which can access, create and delete files within the folder FileServer/ and from
          the source code available at gitHub, it is evident that this pieces are not malicious by itself.<br><Br>
          In Linux systems (particularly), the newly uploaded files, using the provided interface, cannot access, delete or create new files
          or directories due to the security measures of the system itself. But on providing root prvilages to the new files, it may be
          capable of doing things HARMFUL.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="matterHolder shadow randm"><a href="#ErrorThrow"></a>
          <font class="title-in">Do this throw any error?</font><br>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.3;">
            If it does, the known reason is that you are using a linux system and you haven't granted enough rights required
            for the program. To grand this, use <br><code>chmod 775 /path/to/file</code><br>
            Still some problem? Use <br><code>chmod -R 777 /path/to/file</code><br>
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="matterHolder shadow randm bfE0"><a name="errorDir"></a>
          <font class="title-in">Problem while creating directories?</font><br>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.3;">
            This is because you tried to use some special characters like /,|,\,.,&,+ while creating a directory. Try avoiding
            them. It will work for sure.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="matterHolder shadow randm">
          <font class="title-in">Files not getting uploaded?</font><br>
          <p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.3;">
            Three possible reasons..<Br><br>
            First :The upload size set in stat.php has crossed. Try increasing the allowed space for
            uploaded files from <a href="stat.php">here</a>.<br><br>
            Second The maximum POST size is set with a lower value. This can be edited from server configutation from the file php.ini.
            Increase the values of post_max_size and upload_max_filesize to a higher value. Then restart the server and try again.<br><br>
            Third : You haven&apos;t given enough permission for the scripts to work well. Check out the section <i>Do this throw any error?</i> given above.</a>
